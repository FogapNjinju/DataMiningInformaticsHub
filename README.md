# DataMiningInformaticsHub
Welcome to DataMiningInformaticsHub, a comprehensive repository showcasing a series of workshops completed as part of the "Data Mining and Informatics" course at the University of Wolverhampton, Faculty of Science and Engineering (7CS033). This project demonstrates proficiency in applying various data mining techniques, preprocessing methods, clustering, classification, and association rule mining on real-world datasets.

# Project Overview
This repository contains six workshops, each focusing on different aspects of data mining and informatics. The tasks utilize Python libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, NLTK, and mlxtend to process, analyze, and visualize data effectively. The datasets include the "adult" dataset, online retail datasets (Portugal, Sweden, UK), and a Twitter sentiment dataset ("Tweets").

# Workshops Breakdown
Workshop 1: Basic Data Manipulation and Analysis
Capitalize text input and compute circle area based on user input.
Load, split, and swap columns of the "adult" dataset, and compare numerical columns ("age" vs. "hours-per-week").
Workshop 2: Data Preprocessing (15% of grade)
Preprocess the "adult" dataset: display settings, dataset info, handle null values, encode income, and normalize data.
Workshop 3: Classification (25% of grade)
Apply SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and KNN classifiers to predict income in "adult_WS#3".
Compute confusion matrices, evaluation metrics, and feature importance.
Workshop 4: Clustering and PCA (15% of grade)
Perform K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering on "adult_WS4" dataset.
Apply PCA to visualize data in 2D based on income classes.
Workshop 5: Association Rule Mining (10% of grade)
Use the Apriori algorithm on Portugal, Sweden, and UK online retail datasets with varying confidence levels.
Identify and interpret top association rules.
Workshop 6: Sentiment Analysis and Clustering (10% + 15%)
Classify sentiments in the "Tweets" dataset using six classifiers (SVM, RF, KNN, DT, LR, NB) with evaluation metrics.
Decision Tree classification with information gain calculation for binary attributes.
K-Means clustering on 3D points with iteration details.
